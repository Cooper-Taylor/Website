    This is an unordered list:

    <h3>This is an ordered list:</h3>
    <ol id="List!">
        <li>This is step one </li>

        <div>There are 3 types of selectors in CSS:</div>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>The first one is an element selector. It uses the specific element of a html tag to apply styles to them. For example, the style sheet is selecting all h4 tags and coloring them red.</h4></li>
            <li class="green">This is colored because of a class selector! to create a class in the style area, use ."nameofclass"{}, then to apply it to text, use 'class="nameofclass"'. You can apply multiple classes to a specific element by putting spaces between them but having them in the same set of quotations!</li>
            <li id="purple">The last selector is an ID selector! It uses the id of a specific tag from the html document to style that text. As per usual, define the tag, and then to call it, preceed the tag name with a #.</li>
            <li>This is just an extra one, but you can combine these selectors into one by combining them with a comma! Example: div, #name {color: blue;}</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Just like with most logic, there is an 'and' or an 'or' with selectors. You can have an element.class and that will select a specific element with that class.
            You can then have select every child element within a larger element. For example section > p {} would affect all p elements IMMEDIATELY inside a section element, but section p{} would effect every p element, regardless of how embedded, within a section element.
            These do not just work with elements, they can work with classes or ids as well!
            To test for multiple class tags in an element within a selector do .class1.class2{}
            Check W3Schools for more ways to combine selectors!
